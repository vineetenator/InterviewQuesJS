What is a closure?
http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/
A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain.
closure has three scope chains:
	its own scope, 
	access to the outer function’s variables & parameters, and 
	access to the global variables.
Closures’ Rules and Side Effects
1. Closures have access to the outer function’s variable even after the outer function returns: Scope capturing.
2. Closures store references to the outer function’s variables: Scope capturing.
3. Closures Gone Awry: 
	Because closures have access to the updated values of the outer function’s variables, they can also lead to bugs when the outer function’s variable changes with a for loop
